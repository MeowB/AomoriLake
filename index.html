        <h2>Checkout the Legend</h2>
        <p>
          Long, long ago, a gifted boy named Hachirotaro went to the mountain with two friends.
          After a long journey, the group makes their camp in a valley called <a
            href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3775.html" target="-_blank">Oirase</a>. Several days
          later he stays in the camp, in charge of the cooking. In the evening
          when the setting sun had tinted <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3780.html" target="-_blank">the
            mountains</a> a rosy colour, Sanji
          and Kito came back to the camp. They, realising that Hachirotaro wasn't there, went down
          the slope to the stream of water and called him. Hearing their voices, Hachirotaro lifted his face.
          His friends were astounded by his appearance and asked with trembling voices
          "What's the matter with your face?"
